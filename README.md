- **alignments**<br>
alignments for the heavily-filtered (HGAPF) and minimally filtered (T400F) datasets 

- **gene trees**<br>
processed gene trees for HGAPF and T400F datasets (nodes with SH-aLRT support <80 collapsed)

- **species trees**<br>
trees corresponding to all classifications examined, for both HGAPF and T400F datasets (includes raw trees and time-calibrated trees)

- **other data**<br>
processed range data and climatic data for each species

- **diversification analyses**<br>
