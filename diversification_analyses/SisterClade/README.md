Hey Brian,

Thanks again for meeting yesterday and for your feedback about diversification analyses on this project. It would be wonderful to have you involved with analysis/interpretation in whatever capacity you are interested. The things we talked about yesterday were:

1. Running sister clade comparisons between clades occurring largely in high species richness regions vs. low species richness. Mess with the threshold between high and low species richness.

2. Possibly running additional SSE analyses (HiSSE?) of the association between speciation/extinction rates and species richness? I can do some of this, but if you have time and are interested it would be great if you wanted to play around with this. 

3. Tweaking text about diversification models and the interpretation of diversification results. This might include adding a summary table to the SI listing the different methods and their assumptions. 

I am attaching our species-level tree and trait (species richness and climate) data. Note that a few species have NA trait values (because their range maps are unavailable). I can provide detailed info on what the climate variables represent if you need it.

Let me know if you have any questions/comments!
