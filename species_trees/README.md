Species trees output by ExaML ("raw_ExaML_trees") with minimal ("T400F") and extensive ("HGAPF") alignment filtering as well as time-calibrated versions used for analyses ("final_timetrees"). The latter include ExaML trees trimmed to tips corresponding to unique species under the various classifications examined in the study and ASTRAL trees. Also provided is an expanded, high-resolution pdf of the tree used for Figure 1 ("Harveyetal2020_Fig1_tree_HiRes.pdf"), with additional metadata included to facilitate investigation of relationships of interest.
